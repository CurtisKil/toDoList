Split Landing Page

As a new developer, I want to do a daily coding project tutorial to learn new features and deepen my understanding of Web Development.

A landing page that is split vertically down the middle with two choices to click on. Whenever one side is hovered on that one side will stretch out to 75% of the screen.
